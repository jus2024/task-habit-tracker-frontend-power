# Task & Habit Tracker Frontend

A project-specific Kiro Power that gives the agent on-demand context for working on
the Task & Habit Tracker app: its layered architecture, domain rules, and
accessible, responsive React + Tailwind conventions — plus a `fetch` MCP server.

It was authored for that project (inspired by community React/MCP powers such as
[praveenc/kiro-powers](https://github.com/praveenc/kiro-powers)) rather than
installed from a third party, so its contents are reviewed and trusted.

## What's included

### Steering files (`steering/`)

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `architecture.md` | Layered design (domain / storage / state / UI) and rules for changes |
| `domain-rules.md` | Task, tag, habit, streak, and statistics rules |
| `frontend-conventions.md` | Component, form/validation, accessibility, and styling patterns |

### MCP servers (`mcp.json`)

| Server | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `fetch` (`uvx mcp-server-fetch`) | Retrieve up-to-date docs from URLs during development |

## When to load steering files

- Working on the app's architecture or a new feature -> `architecture.md`
- Changing task/tag/habit/streak/stats behavior -> `domain-rules.md`
- Building or styling UI components -> `frontend-conventions.md`

## Requirements

- [uv / uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) available on PATH (for the MCP server).
- Node.js 18+ for the app itself.
